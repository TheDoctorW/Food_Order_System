# Background

Your consultancy firm has been called in to Australiaâ€™s largest burger food chain GourmetBurgers for a new software project.   The client is interested in developing an online self-service ordering application.    The client feels that such a system would provide faster delivery of meals to customers, enable customers to build their own gourmet creations which would result in improving the revenue at the different franchises of the food chain.

# Preliminary Requirements

The online application offers three types of services:

 1. Customers - Place Online Orders
 2. Staff - Service Online Orders
 3. Staff  - Maintain Inventory

### 1. Customer - Online Orders

**Mains**
At any GourmetBurger outlet, a customer can create two types of mains, a burger or a wrap and order their gourmet creation.  For each selected main, a customer can choose:

1. type and number of buns (e.g., 3 sesame buns for a double burger or 2 muffin buns for a standard single burger) - the number of buns cannot exceed the maximum allowable     limit (e.g., if only single, double and triple burgers are permitted, then the customer cannot choose more than 4 buns)
3. type and number of patties (e.g., 2 chicken patties, vegetarian, beef). here again, customers are restricted to the maximum allowable patties
 4. other ingredients of their choice such as tomato, lettuce, tomato sauce, cheddar cheese, swiss cheese etc.
Each of the mains (burger or wrap) has a base price, and each ingredient carries an additional price, so once a customer has completed their gourmet creation, the net price of their created main will be calculated based on the chosen ingredients and displayed to the customer.

**Sides and Drinks**
Besides the main, a customer can (optionally) order sides (e.g., a 6 pack nuggets, 3 pack nuggets, fries (small, medium, large)) and drink(s) of their choice.

Once, a customer has completed their selection (main, side and drink), they can checkout to complete their order. At this point, they will be issued with an order-id.  At any point in time, the customer should be able to check if their order is ready to be collected using their order-id.  The customer can check the status of their order at any point to see if their order is completed.

### 2. Staff - Service Orders

The staff can view the current orders at any point in time.  Once a customer's order has been cooked, they will update the status of the order to indicate that the order is available for pickup by the customer.  The customer should be able to see this change in status at their end when they refresh their page. This order will now disappear from staff orders menu.

### 3. Staff - Maintain Inventory
Staff will also be responsible for maintaining the inventory of their various ingredients.   Periodically, they will refill their stock.  As a customer places an order (e.g. a double burger with 2 chicken patties and cheddar cheese) will result in the inventory levels being decremented accordingly.  At any point in time, if a particular ingredient is not available, the customer will not be able to select the particular item to their order.
Burgers, wraps, nuggets are all stocked in whole quantities.
Bottled drinks are stocked in either cans (375 ml) or bottles (600 ml) and drinks such as orange juice will be served in varying sizes (e.g., a small = 250 ml, a medium = 450 ml etc).
Sides such as fries will need to be stocked by weight (in gms). For example, a small fries = 75g, a medium fries = 125 g and if a customer orders a medium fries, this would reduce the inventory levels by 125g.
